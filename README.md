# Tama Marketplace

## What is the Tama?
- Tama Marketplace is a blockchain-based data trading platform. This platform provides a space for users to upload and sell data. Data providers receive rewards when their data is sold. Tama Marketplace uses FVM (Flexible Virtual Machine) technology to allow users to upload and manage data, maintaining its immutability and security through smart contracts. The platform offers a secure and convenient space for buying and selling data, crucial for training artificial intelligence models. Additionally, it is being developed to utilize artificial intelligence for data curation.

## Background
- Currently, AI is a field of greatest interest and a good technology. However, to create AI, training data is needed. This data requires a huge amount and requires storage that can contain it. Also, it is a good idea to easily obtain such training data and obtain good data that has been reviewed for constancy, accuracy, and stability. Therefore, we create this data in blockchain form and provide a marketplace, a space where data can be easily and conveniently stored in storage and sold/purchased. We use FVM so that users can upload data to storage, store it, upload it to a contract, manage the immutability and security of the data, and sell the data on the marketplace to receive rewards (sale amount) for it.
